# AmpliPi POE Touchscreen Controller
A POE-powered touchscreen controller designed to control [AmpliPi](https://amplipi.com), using the Olimex ESP32-PoE board.

Currently a work in progress, nearing initial release.

Built using VS Code with Platform.IO.

### Preview of device and UI
##### Primary screen with currently playing metadata:

#### Currently supported hardware
- Olimex ESP32-PoE board
- ILI9341 or ILI9488 compatible TFT touchscreen with resolutions of 240x320 or 320x480

#### Basic setup instructions
1. Wire the TFT touchscreen to the ESP32-PoE using the UEXT connector (PCB details coming soon). Edit platform.ini as needed.

###### Pin selection for the Olimex ESP32-PoE board's UEXT connector
- TFT_CS=15
- TFT_RST=5
- TFT_DC=2
- TFT_MOSI=13
- TFT_SCLK=14
- TFT_MISO=16
- TFT_BL=16
- DTOUCH_CS=4

2. Clone this Github project
3. Upload Filesystem Image to ESP32-PoE (this uploads the files in the data folder to the ESP32's file system)
4. Compile and upload to ESP32-PoE
5. Power on controller. It will look for an AmpliPi to http://amplipi.local

A 3D printable faceplate design will be available after the first controller release.

Note: WiFi functionality on the ESP32-PoE is not available in this repo. If WiFi is needed, use the WiFi repo: https://github.com/kjk2010/AmpliPi-Touchscreen-Keypad
