# AmpliPi-POE-Touchscreen-Keypad
POE-powered touchscreen controller for AmpliPi
A touchscreen keypad designed to control AmpliPi, using the Olimex ESP32-PoE board.

For the WiFi version, go to this repo: https://github.com/kjk2010/AmpliPi-Touchscreen-Keypad

Currently a work in progress, nearing initial release.

Built using VS Code with Platform.IO.

#### Currently supported hardware
- Olimex ESP32-PoE board
- ILI9341 or ILI9488 compatible TFT touchscreen

#### Basic setup instructions
1. Wire the TFT touchscreen to the ESP32-PoE using the UEXT connector (PCB details coming soon). Edit platform.ini as needed.

###### Pin selection for the Olimex ESP32-PoE board's UEXT connector
- TFT_CS=15
- TFT_RST=5
- TFT_DC=2
- TFT_MOSI=13
- TFT_SCLK=14
- TFT_MISO=16
- TFT_BL=16
- DTOUCH_CS=4

2. Clone this Github project
3. Upload Filesystem Image to ESP32-PoE (this uploads the files in the data folder to the ESP32's file system)
4. Compile and upload to ESP32-PoE
5. Replace app.py from the amplipi folder on the AmpliPi server. This patch includes the 'get_stream_image' function to provide album art to the controller. Requires 'pillow' python3 library (pip3 install pillow).

Note: WiFi functionality on the ESP32-PoE is not available in this repo. If WiFi is needed, use the WiFi repo: https://github.com/kjk2010/AmpliPi-Touchscreen-Keypad
